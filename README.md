# vacplus

This repo is for vacplus.com, with some sample code to showcase the work of Jacob Mompean. For ShopSite Pro, the CMS we used, all of the templates are entered in html format with PHP embedded.

Please see "-SMP-product-full-width_Gift-Guide.html" in the root & in the /-VP-templates/ folder there are many more examples of my recent code, good places to start are "-VP-product-3col.html" and "-VP-product.html".
